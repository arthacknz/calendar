## Note on hosting

We are now sharing the hosting role for art~hack so the responsiblity does not rest on any one person's shoulders. Therefore, it's really important we keep this calendar up to date. Please pre-populate it in advance if you can host. If you can't host anymore, request the core member group to see if someone else can take the reigns!
